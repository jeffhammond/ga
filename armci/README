                                   ARMCI
                   Agregate Remote Memory Copy Interface

Implementation status as of 04.30.98:

A. Supported Platforms
   1. shared-memory systems: SUN Solaris, SGI, IBM, Linux, DEC, HP, Cray J90,
      and Windows NT/95
   2. distributed-memory systems: Cray T3E, IBM SP 

Notes: 
   1. Clusters of workstations not implemented yet.
   2. TARGET=SGI generates a MIPS-4 64-bit code with 32-bit address space 
      (N32 ABI) For 64-bit address space SGI64 should be used. 
   2. On IBM SP need at least PSSP 2.3 (with LAPI). Use TARGET=LAPI. 
      TARGET=SP is reserved for the MPL-based implementation which will work
      on all IBM SP-X systems regardless of the PSSP level.
   3. At present time ARMCI requires MPI. To date tested with SGI, Cray 
      and MPI implementations in addition to MPICH and  WMPI (NT). 
   4. Files windows.mak and windows.mdp in ./src contain makefile and project 
      file for Microsoft Visual C/C++ 4.0 and Fortran PowerStation 4.0.
   5. GNU make is required on Unix.

B. What is missing/To-Do List:
   1. Nonblocking interface
   2. ARMCI_Poll
   4. Platform-specific performance tunning (primarily IBM SP).
   5. More ports (including clusters of workstations/SMPs).
    
C. Documentation and examples
   1. Limited documentation is in files .doc/armci.[ps,pdf]
   2. Examples are in test.c. It builds into test.x.

D. Added functionality (not documented in ./doc/armci.[ps,pdf])
   1. ARMCI_Rmw - atomic read-modify-write

E. How to build it?
   1. Define environment variable TARGET ("setenv TARGET SOLARIS").
      The official TARGET names are shown in ./config/makefile.h 
   2. If MPI is not in the compiler system include and library paths,
      MPI_LIB and MPI_INCLUDE environment variables should be defined.
      For example, on my SGI I got:
        setenv MPI_LIB /msrc/dist/mpi/mpich/lib/IRIX/ch_shmem
        setenv MPI_INCLUDE /msrc/dist/mpi/mpich/include
   3. Type "make" in ./src to build libarmci.a which goes into armci/lib/$TARGET
   4. Type "make test.x" to build the example program.
