                                   ARMCI
                   Agregate Remote Memory Copy Interface
             http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/docs/parsoft/armci

Implementation status as of January, 2001:

A. Supported Platforms
   1. shared-memory systems: SUN Solaris, SGI, IBM, Linux, DEC, HP, Cray SV1,
      and Windows NT/95
   2. distributed-memory systems: Cray T3E, IBM SP(TARGET=LAPI), FUJITSU VX/VPP 
   3. clusters of workstations (sockets, Myrinet, VIA, Qudarics supported)

Notes: 
   1. TARGET=SGI generates a MIPS-4 64-bit code with 32-bit address space 
      (N32 ABI) For 64-bit address space SGI64 should be used. 
   2. On IBM SP need at least PSSP 2.3 (with LAPI). Use TARGET=LAPI. 
   3. ARMCI runs with MPI (default), PVM, TCGMSG message-passing libraries.
      Tested with MPI vendor implementations in addition to MPICH and WMPI (NT).
      Tested with PVM 3.4 on SGI and Cray PVM on the T3E only (doc/README.PVM).
      Tested TCGMSG by developers of the  NWChem package on many platforms.
   4. GNU make is required on Unix. For command line build on Windows, 
      simply call MS nmake instead of GNU make.
   5. As a general rule, 64-bit versions can be built by appending to
      64 to the TARGET name (HPUX, SOLARIS, LINUX64(alpha), IBM, LAPI, FUJITSU)

C. Documentation and examples
   1. Limited documentation is in files ./doc/armci.pdf
   2. Test programs are in src/(test.c,perf.c). It builds into (test.x,perf.x)
   3. SPLASH LU benchmark is in ./examples

D. How to build it?
   1. Define environment variable TARGET ("setenv TARGET SOLARIS").
      The official TARGET names are shown in ./config/makefile.h 
   2. If MPI is not known to the system compilers, add include and library paths
      MPI_LIB and MPI_INCLUDE environment variables should be defined.
      For example, on my SGI I got:
        setenv MPI_LIB /msrc/dist/mpi/mpich/lib/IRIX/ch_shmem
        setenv MPI_INCLUDE /msrc/dist/mpi/mpich/include

      An alternative solution is to call "make CC=mpicc" in Step 3 &4.

   3. Type "make" in ./src to build libarmci.a which goes into armci/lib/$TARGET
   4. Type "make test.x" to build the example program. 

   NOTE: for workstation clusters with special networks, ARMCI_NETWORK
         muste be set (GM,VIA,QUADRICS) to specify the protocol.
