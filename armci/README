                                   ARMCI
                   Agregate Remote Memory Copy Interface
             http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/docs/parsoft/armci

Implementation status as of 06.30.99:

A. Supported Platforms
   1. shared-memory systems: SUN Solaris, SGI, IBM, Linux, DEC, HP, Cray J90,
      and Windows NT/95
   2. distributed-memory systems: Cray T3E, IBM SP(TARGET=LAPI), FUJITSU VX/VPP 
   3. clusters of UNIX workstations

Notes: 
   1. TARGET=SGI generates a MIPS-4 64-bit code with 32-bit address space 
      (N32 ABI) For 64-bit address space SGI64 should be used. 
   2. On IBM SP need at least PSSP 2.3 (with LAPI). Use TARGET=LAPI. 
   3. ARMCI runs with MPI (default), PVM, TCGMSG message-passing libraries.
      Tested with MPI vendor implementations in addition to MPICH and WMPI (NT).
      Tested with PVM 3.4 on SGI and Cray PVM on the T3E only (doc/README.PVM).
      Tested TCGMSG by developers of the  NWChem package on many platforms.
   4. Files windows.mak and windows.mdp in ./src contain makefile and project 
      file for Microsoft Visual C/C++ 4.0 and Fortran PowerStation 4.0.
   5. GNU make is required on Unix. For command line build on Windows, 
      simply call MS nmake instead of GNU make.

C. Documentation and examples
   1. Limited documentation is in files .doc/armci.[ps,pdf]
   2. Examples are in test.c. It builds into test.x.

D. Added functionality (not documented in ./doc/armci.[ps,pdf])
   1. ARMCI_Rmw - atomic read-modify-write
   2. ARMCI_Lock/Unlock - locks

E. How to build it?
   1. Define environment variable TARGET ("setenv TARGET SOLARIS").
      The official TARGET names are shown in ./config/makefile.h 
   2. If MPI is not known to the system compilers, add include and library paths
      MPI_LIB and MPI_INCLUDE environment variables should be defined.
      For example, on my SGI I got:
        setenv MPI_LIB /msrc/dist/mpi/mpich/lib/IRIX/ch_shmem
        setenv MPI_INCLUDE /msrc/dist/mpi/mpich/include

      The recent releases of MPICH use two include directories that complicates
      this setup.  The best solution is to call "make CC=mpicc" in Step 3 &4.

   3. Type "make" in ./src to build libarmci.a which goes into armci/lib/$TARGET
   4. Type "make test.x" to build the example program. 

F. Platform specific issues
   . IBM SP under PSSP 3.1 (Troutbeck), define environment variable 
     "setenv MP_MSG_API lapi" when running with TCGMSG and
     "setenv MP_MSG_API mpi,lapi" when running with MPI
     Older versions of PSSP do not require this.
