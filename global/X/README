                     xregion -- GA visualization tool


xregion displays transitional access patterns for a two-dimensional
array.  Both sampling time for the animation and slowdown factor can be
specified to animate long- and short- lasting events. At the end of
animation, a cumulative time lost due to contention in access to
individual array elements is displayed. The color coding (from white to
navy) reflect access contention level for the animation, and the access
contention integral for the final display.

The usage:
~~~~~~~~~ 
xregion <grid_size> <scale> <filename> <num_events> [max_integr] 
        [Xtoolkit options]

where:

                   mandatory arguments
grid_size        - number of pixels in each direction
scale            - number of pixels per array element 
filename         - name of the input file (data processed by 'adjust' program)
num_events       - the number of events to be read and processed from filename
	           (might be specified larger than teh actual number records)

	           optional arguments
max_integr       - maximum value of access collision integral - used to limit
	           the range of interest for the access contention
Xtoolkit options - Xtoolkit options


xregion is a wrapper script that specifies my color preferences for xregion0.

The program was tested on the SUN platform only !
It is a 16-bit display version. 


Example:
~~~~~~~
xregion 100 4 adjust.ed 50
