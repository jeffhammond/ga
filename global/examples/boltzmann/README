This directory contains the source code for a simple lattice Boltzmann
simulation of flow in a lid-driven cavity. The algorithm used is
described in BJ Palmer and DR Rector, Journal of Computational Physics, vol.
161, pp. 1-20 (2000). The temperature has been set to a constant for this
simulation, eliminating the need for the second distribution. The output from
the simulation is sent to the file bltz.gmv and can be viewed using the General
Meshh Viewer program developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. More
information on this program can be obtained from the web page at
http://www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/GMVHome.html.

The global arrays used in the code are all declared in the file main.F and
then passed by reference to the subroutines. The output file is created by the
subroutine in printdat.F; if you are interested in writing your own output
routine, you should consult this file. The size of the grid used for the
simulation is set in the include file "common" using the variable NSIZE, the
remaining system parameters are set in the subroutine in setup.F.
