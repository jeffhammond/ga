This is an implementation of the TCGMSG library on top of MPI.

Heteregenous platforms are currently not supported.

The TCGSMG nxtval operation is implemented by either using
shared/global memory, interrupt-receive, or with a "hidden process".

In the latter case, the  number of processes TCGMSG application
is able to use is equal to the size of MPI_GROUP_WORLD minus one.
