This directory contains a prototype of the Disk Resident Arrays library.

You need GNU make (version > 3.68) to build this software.

To build test program type:  

make test.x

Documentation is located in disk_arrays.doc and implementation
notes in Notes.doc.

Running test programs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At present time, test.F and perf.F have meta-file names that include
hardwired paths of the high-performance filesystems on machines that 
I am using. 

YOU MUST UPDATE THESE NAMES TO GET THESE PROGRAMS TO WORK ! 


Due to memory requirements perf.x requires a minimum number of processors
it can be run on. The current setup is for 32 processors, except for
the IBM SP where 16 is sufficient. 

Changing default PIOFS configuration (in particular setting USE_PIOFS_LSEEK)
in piofs.profile on the IBM SP is discouraged.


Platforms that Disk Arrays were tested on:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Intel Paragon
Cray T3D
IBM SP
KSR
SGI (Power Challenge)
SUN
